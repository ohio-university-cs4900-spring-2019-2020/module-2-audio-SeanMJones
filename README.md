## Module Description

Goal: Demonstrate 2D and 3D audio inside of the game engine.

Changes made to achieve this goal:

    * Added WASD camera controls
    * Added ability to press 'T' to pause all 2D sounds
    * Added ability to press 'R' to resume all 2D sounds
    * Added ability to press 'E' to stop all 2D sounds
    * Added ability to press 'X' to create a new 3D object with a 3D sound in same position
    * Added offset to creating 3D objects and sounds so they don't spawn in same position
    * Added 2D song that plays on program start

Summary: 

On running the program, a 2D background song called 'bestDayEver.mp3' will start playing. The user can pause, resume, and completely stop this song with 'T', 'R' and 'E' respectively. To demonstrate 3D sounds the user must press 'X' which will spawn a 3D cube and play an acommpanying 3D sound called 'windowsXpErrorSound.mp3' in the same position that the cube spawns. The user can also now move the camera with standard WASD movement controls.
